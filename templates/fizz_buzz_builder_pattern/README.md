# Deliberate Practice for FizzBuzz Using the Builder Pattern

## Problem:

The task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Deliberate Practice Approach:

### Understanding the Problem:
- Fully understand the FizzBuzz requirements, especially the conditions for printing numbers, "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz".

### Builder Pattern Steps:
1. **Define Product**: Identify the final product of the Builder Pattern, which in this case is the output of the FizzBuzz logic across the range 1 to 100.
2. **Create Builder Interface**: Design an interface for building the parts of the FizzBuzz solution. This interface might include methods for adding "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", and numbers.
3. **Implement Concrete Builders**: Develop different builders for constructing the FizzBuzz sequence in various formats or configurations (e.g., a string builder, a list builder, etc.).
4. **Director Logic**: Implement a director class or function that takes a builder object and constructs the desired output by applying the FizzBuzz logic. The director decides when to add "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or numbers based on the current iteration.
5. **Client Code**: Write the client code that uses the director and the concrete builders to construct the FizzBuzz output. The client should be able to choose or switch builders easily if multiple output formats are needed.
6. **Refine and Expand**: Experiment with creating different types of builders for various output formats or requirements (e.g., HTML, JSON, plain text) to explore the flexibility of the Builder Pattern.

### Builder Pattern Specifics:
- This approach encourages a step-by-step construction of a complex product (the FizzBuzz sequence) in a flexible and controlled manner.
- It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, making it possible to use the same construction process to create different representations.
- Particularly useful for cases where a variety of outputs or configurations are desired from the same construction process.
