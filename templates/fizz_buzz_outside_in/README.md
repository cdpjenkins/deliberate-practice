# Deliberate Practice for FizzBuzz Using Outside-In TDD

## Problem:

The task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Deliberate Practice Approach:

### Understanding the Problem:
- Grasp the FizzBuzz requirements thoroughly, ensuring clarity on the conditions for printing numbers, "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz".

### Outside-In TDD Steps:
1. **Begin with the End in Mind**: Start by writing a high-level test for the expected outcome of the program (e.g., the complete output from 1 to 100). This test will fail initially but serves as a goal for the development process.
2. **Define Interfaces**: Break down the problem into smaller components (e.g., a component that determines the output for a single number) and define interfaces for these components. Write failing tests for these interfaces.
3. **Implement Inner Components**: Choose one of the smaller components to implement first. Write a test for the simplest behavior within this component and make the test pass with the simplest implementation. Continue this process, working from the inside-out, implementing functionality and refactoring as you go.
4. **Integrate Components**: Once the inner components are implemented and their tests are passing, start integrating them with the outer layers of your application. Write integration tests as necessary to ensure the components work together as expected.
5. **Fulfill the High-Level Test**: Continue development and refactoring until the initial high-level test passes. This indicates that the application meets the requirements of the FizzBuzz problem.
6. **Refactor and Clean Up**: With all tests passing, refactor your code for readability, maintainability, and performance. The safety net of your tests allows you to make changes with confidence.

### Outside-In Specifics:
- This approach emphasizes starting with the overall goal of the application and gradually implementing the details, allowing for a clear understanding of how each component fits into the whole.
- It is particularly useful in scenarios where the architecture or high-level design plays a crucial role in the application's functionality and success.
